                Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician and autodidact born in Erode, Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu). Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory,
                infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became apparent to the wider mathematical community,
                centered in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership with the English mathematician <a href="https://goo.gl/kiVtxk" target="_blank">G. H. Hardy</a>, who realized that Ramanujan had rediscovered previously known
                theorems in addition to producing new ones.

                During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations).Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct, although some were already known.He stated results that were both original and highly unconventional,
                such as the <a href="https://goo.gl/1fdcsP" target="_blank" class="text-capitalize">Ramanujan prime</a> and the <a href="https://goo.gl/STJikd" target="_blank" class="text-capitalize">Ramanujan theta function</a>, and these
                have inspired a vast amount of further research.The Ramanujan Journal, an international publication, was launched to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by his work.

                    I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting
                    number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."</p>
